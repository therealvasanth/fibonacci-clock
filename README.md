# Fibonacci Clock - web version

The clock for geeks now in web version.

## Getting Started

To tell time on the Fibonacci clock you need to do some math. Follow the steps below to get the time:

* To read the hour, simply add up the corresponding values of the red and blue squares.
* To read the minutes, do the same with the green and blue squares. The minutes are displayed in 5-minute increments (0 to 12), so you have to multiply your result by 5 to get the actual number.
